> **Start with your top five.**

> They are your most powerful natural talents.

> 1. Read everything about your top CliftonStrengths. To make the most of your talents, you first need to understand them and how to describe them to others.
> 2. Reflect on who you are. Think about your experiences, your motivations and how you see yourself. Then, consider how your CliftonStrengths shape you: what you do, how you do it and why.
> 3. Use these CliftonStrengths every day. Start with the suggestions in this report for applying your most powerful CliftonStrengths.
