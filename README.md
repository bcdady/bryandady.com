This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

This functions as a personal home page and learning opportunity for me to practice frontend technologies.

This site is deployed to [bryandady.com](https://bryandady.com) via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)).

I spend a significant amount of my professional time on backend and infrastructure technologies, so sometimes it's a fun
and helpful change of scenery to work in JAMstack, TypeScript, React and related web technologies.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

I've integrated deployment from this GitHub repository to my account in Cloudflare.
