# About Me

In 4 key words from my [CliftonStrengths Themes](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/home/en-us/cliftonstrengths-themes-domains), I am a _Strategic_ _Learner_ and a _Commanding_ _Achiever_. 

I enjoy collaborating with others to collect and analyze data for insights into how we can apply technology innovations to improve how we work together and ultimately increase the value provided to the customer community. 

<!-- Overly verbose Summary from   https://my.indeed.com/resume -->

I first fell in love with IT by investigating the PC my dad ran his small business on, and then learning how to fix it. Over the years I've continued to improve and refine my skills and techniques, but I retain the raw fascination and passion for understanding how technologies work, and then sharing with others how the right solutions can help in their pursuits.

After proving my technical chops in the field, I elected to pursue a communications degree, so that I could better understand, discuss and explain to others how we could best collaborate to find the right solutions. Some of my proudest moments include bridging previously strained relationships and projects to align factions of different perspectives -- such as engineering and support, Windows / Unix, IBM/HP, Windows / Linux, EMC/NetApp, Windows / Mac ... hopefully you're getting the picture.

I feel a sense of accomplishment and joy when I find the persuasive opportunity to dislodge previously stalled negotiations, and bring stakeholders to the table for a mutually successful result. If this sounds like any scenario that you might like help with, I'd be glad to hear from you.

In terms of CliftonStrengths (StrengthsFinder Themes), I am a Strategic Learner and a Commanding Achiever. My leadership style is influenced by the likes of Patrick Lencioni, Simon Sinek and Manager Tools (The Effective Manager).

I have accumulated broad business and technology experience, with depth in financial services, and recent emphasis on DevOps, Cloud, and Digital Transformation. I thrive when collaborating with others to collect and analyze data for insights into how we can continuously improve our efficacy and increase the value provided to the customer community.
