## Description

Opens a specified [PowerShell module](https://github.com/topics/powershell-modules), for editing, in a specified editor / IDE.

This was designed and developed back in the days when I worked on Windows and PowerShell came with [PowerShellISE](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/differences-between-the-ise-and-powershell-console/), but also Visual Studio Code was new on the scene. I wanted Edit-Module to be portable for a similar, convenient workflow on Windows machines, that only had PowerShellISE available, as well as with ["PowerShell Core 6.0"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-core-6-0-generally-available-ga-and-supported/) and VSCode.
