### TFSumPy - Terraform Plan Summary Tool

I contributed to [TFSumPy](https://github.com/rafaelherik/tfsumpy), a Python tool that generates concise summaries of Terraform plan outputs. This tool helps DevOps teams quickly understand infrastructure changes without parsing verbose plan files.

**My contributions:**

- Added GitHub Issue templates, using the latest/greatest style
- Added [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/rafaelherik/tfsumpy/blob/main/docs/contributing.md)
- Added Bandit security scanning to GitHub Actions Workflows
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved output (markdown) formatting
- Added support for Taskfile to help contributors (locally) ensure they'll have a successful CI pipeline after pushing changes
