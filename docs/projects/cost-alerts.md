# cost-alerts

Multi-cloud cost monitoring setup using Terraform.

## Technologies

- [HCL (Terraform)](https://terraform.io)
  - [AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
  - [Azure provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)
  - [GCP provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs)

## Description

Demo project for [BLDRCon Spring 25](https://www.bldrnet.com/about/) showing how to use Terraform to set up cloud cost monitoring across Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

The session was titled "Cloud Cost Observability In Action". When I find the right link to YouTube I'll add it.
