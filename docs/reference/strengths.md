\[My\] CliftonStrengths

> **The CliftonStrengths at the top of your profile are the most powerful.**

> These themes represent how you are uniquely talented. They are the starting point for living your strongest life possible.

> **Develop these CliftonStrengths to maximize your potential**

> Your greatest chance to succeed — at work or anywhere else — lies in strengthening what you naturally do best and doing more of it.

> **Start with your top five.**

> They are your most powerful natural talents.

> 1. Read everything about your top CliftonStrengths. To make the most of your talents, you first need to understand them and how to describe them to others.
> 2. Reflect on who you are. Think about your experiences, your motivations and how you see yourself. Then, consider how your CliftonStrengths shape you: what you do, how you do it and why.
> 3. Use these CliftonStrengths every day. Start with the suggestions in this report for applying your most powerful CliftonStrengths.
> 4. Watch out for blind spots. Sometimes how you exhibit your strongest CliftonStrengths can cause unintended negative misperceptions. Read the “What Is a Weakness?” section to learn more about preventing your strongest CliftonStrengths from getting in your way.

> **Then focus on your CliftonStrengths 6-10.**

> Apply the same strategies to make the most of your next five CliftonStrengths. You will excel and become the absolute best version of yourself when you take a strengths-based approach to your life. Do more of what you do best, and you’ll feel more engaged, empowered and energized.
