## Description

Manage my GitHub repository configurations in Terraform for consistent setup and maintenance.
I haven't done much here yet. This is something I'd like to work on, as an opportunity to experiment with another Terraform provider.

The idea here is have a Terraform module for my preferred GitHub repository configurations, such as branch rules/rulesets, [security settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#enabling-or-disabling-security-and-analysis-features-for-public-repositories), and PR/merge settings.
