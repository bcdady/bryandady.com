# About Me

In 4 key words from my [CliftonStrengths Themes](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/home/en-us/cliftonstrengths-themes-domains), I am a _Strategic_ _Learner_ and a _Commanding_ _Achiever_. 

I enjoy collaborating with others to collect and analyze data for insights into how we can apply technology innovations to improve how we work together and ultimately increase the value provided to the customer community. 

I first fell in love with IT by investigating the PC my dad ran his small business on, and then learning how to fix it. Over the years I've continued to improve and refine my skills and techniques, but I retain the raw fascination and passion for understanding how technologies work, and then sharing with others how the right solutions can help in their pursuits.
