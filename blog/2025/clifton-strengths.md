I first encountered Strength oriented personality and proficiency assessment, referred to at the time as StrengthsFinder, in 2011. I was pretty busy at the time, with 2 children under 2 years old and a full-time job (with a pretty long commute). I don't recall the details clearly, but I think my first access to the book was a second-hand copy. I purchased another copy of the StrengthsFinder 2.0 book, in 2015, so I could get my own access code to their online tools at [www.strengthsfinder.com](https://www.strengthsfinder.com).

[CliftonStrengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CliftonStrengths) (previously referred to as StrengthsFinder) is a professional assessment system that helps individuals identify their unique strengths and talents. It is based on the theory of positive psychology and is designed to help people achieve their full potential. The assessment is based on the idea that everyone has a set of innate talents and strengths that can be developed and used to achieve success in various areas of life.

> The Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment was created under the leadership of educational psychologist Donald Clifton. He wanted to identify the skills of the best of the best of the best, and to capitalize on them. Thus the StrengthsFinder assessment, a revolutionary tool for measuring talents, was first introduced to the world

By 2015, we had moved from western Washington to Missoula Montana. My employer had a modest leadership investment budget, and I had the privilege of traveling to an industry conference in San Diego. Part of this conference agenda was a workshop on CliftonStrengths. By 2020 I had moved to a new job, working fully remote, and I had another opportunity to go through the CliftonStrengths assessment. I found it very helpful to review and compare my skills and strengths and talents, and to use the report to work with my new organization to share with them more about my strengths and work style.

Here's what my CliftonStrengths assessment reveals about me:
